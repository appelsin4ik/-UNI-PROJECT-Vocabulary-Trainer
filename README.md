# Vocabulary Trainer (UNI Project)

A vocabulary trainer app built as a university project, designed to help users learn and test foreign language vocabulary in a structured way.

**NOTE:** This repo was originally created by a teammate, and Iâ€™m proud to have contributed and now maintain a copy here.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose & Goals

- Provide a simple but effective way for learners to **practice vocabulary** with different modes (e.g. translation, multiple choice, etc.)  
- Support adding, editing, deleting vocabulary sets (words + translations)  
- Track user performance, show progress  
- Design with clarity and usability in mind  
- Use clean code standards and diagrams to support maintainability
