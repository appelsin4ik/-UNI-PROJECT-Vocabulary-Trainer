# Vocabulary Trainer (UNI Project)

A vocabulary trainer app built as a university project, designed to help users learn and test foreign language vocabulary in a structured way.

**NOTE:** This repo was originally created by a teammate, and I’m proud to have contributed and now maintain a copy here.

## 🎯 Purpose & Goals

- Provide a simple but effective way for learners to **practice vocabulary** with different modes (e.g. translation, multiple choice, etc.)  
- Support adding, editing, deleting vocabulary sets (words + translations)  
- Track user performance, show progress  
- Design with clarity and usability in mind  
- Use clean code standards and diagrams to support maintainability

The project includes (or aims to include) the following:

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| Vocabulary Management | Create / Edit / Delete vocabulary lists |
| Practice Modes | Translate words, multiple-choice quizzes, etc. |
| Progress Tracking | Show user statistics and successes/failures |
| UI / Design | Clean, minimal interface for ease of use |

## 👥 My Contribution & Role

During this university project, I was actively involved in several key areas:

- 💻 **Implementation:**  
  Developed core Java functionality for vocabulary practice logic (quiz, input validation, word matching, etc.)

- 🧩 **Integration:**  
  Helped connect different project modules, ensuring smooth cooperation between GUI and logic components

- 🧠 **Concept & Design:**  
  Contributed to designing the app structure and creating UML diagrams (Use Case & Activity diagrams)

- 🪶 **Documentation:**  
  Participated in writing and proofreading the *Benutzerhandbuch (User Manual)* and *Pflichtenheft (Requirements Document)*

- 🔍 **Testing & Debugging:**  
  Tested the app features, reported and fixed several logical bugs

- 🤝 **Team Collaboration:**  
  Worked closely with teammates to coordinate tasks, track progress, and make design decisions

> ⚡ *I focused on making the application stable, clean, and user-friendly — combining both technical and creative aspects of the project.*

**Localization & Improvements (Future Goals):**  
- 🌍 Plan to add **English language support**, improve **UI responsiveness**, and optimize the **user experience**

> 💡 *Note:*  
> - The project was mainly **developed on macOS** — it runs on Windows as well, but there might be **minor display issues with emojis** in some UI components.  
> - The application is currently **only available in German**, but adding **English localization** and other improvements is planned for the future.
