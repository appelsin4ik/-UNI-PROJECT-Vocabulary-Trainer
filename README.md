# Vocabulary Trainer (UNI Project)

A vocabulary trainer app built as a university project, designed to help users learn and test foreign language vocabulary in a structured way.

**NOTE:** This repo was originally created by a teammate, and I’m proud to have contributed and now maintain a copy here.
